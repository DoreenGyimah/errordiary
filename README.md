## What is the error diary? 
<hr>
This is an app that is focused on coding students. It allows them to keep track of all their errors and allow them to store the solutions for each. 
<br>
Very handy for when they run into future errors because they have something to cross reference.

Our app stores new users and their errors. We also implemented the function for them to comment on other users errors. This ceates a community of coders helping each other through obstacles in their apps/websites.

The above and below images show a dynamic navigation bar. When a guest comes to the website, it will show them a log-in and sign-up button along with 'Home' and 'Challenges'link.

## Home Page

Below shows the details page for an individual error. This is also a dynamic page that we will demonstrate.

## Error Detail Page

We included authentication on this page by not allowing other users edit posts that do not belong to them. In this page you can view other user comments on your issue, edit the error (if you are the owner) or delete it.

## Webscraping Page

We added an extra feature. Our app web scrapes from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) to gather different coding problems so that people can practice their coding skills... and if they have errors.. they can post it on our app to crowdsource a solution!
